<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

● HTML is used to provide the content(words, images, audio, video, and so on) to
the web pages.
● HTML is a tag-based language. They are defined within the angle brackets(< >)

HTML tags and elements
● HTML tags are surrounded by the two characters < and > (They are called angle brackets)
● The tag name can either start from an alphabet or an underscore( _ )
● The text between the start and end tags is the element content.
● Tags with an opening and closing can have any number of tags within themselves
● HTML tags are not case sensitive, <p> means the same as <P>
● HTML tags normally comes in pairs(container tags), i.e. both opening and
closing(it is the same, just the name of the tag with the character '/ ' in the beginning) tag
● Eg: <html> and </html> is a tag that comes in pair
● E.g., <br> does not have a closing tag
● You might come across "self-closing" tags, whereby a br tag, for, e.g.., will look like <br/> instead of simply <br>.
